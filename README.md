This algorithm initializes three counters (length, word, and vowel) and defines a set of vowels. It iterates through each character in a sentence, incrementing counters for length, words (on spaces), and vowels. Special consideration is given for the last character being a period. Finally, it displays the length of the sentence, number of words, and number of vowels.
